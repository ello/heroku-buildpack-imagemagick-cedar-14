Heroku Buildpack ImageMagick Cedar 14
===========================

Use the latest version of ImageMagick inside Heroku  _Cedar 14_.

ImageMagick 6.8 [won't be
merged](https://bugs.launchpad.net/ubuntu/+source/imagemagick/+bug/1179054) into Ubuntu until Ubuntu vivid is released.

This buildpack downloads and installs the [vivid
packages](https://launchpad.net/ubuntu/vivid/arm64/imagemagick/8:6.8.9.9-2)
manually.

## Usage

Heroku now supports using multiple buildpacks for an app - see
[here](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/using-multiple-buildpacks-for-an-app)
for more info.

So in your app you need to do:

```
heroku buildpacks:set --index 1
https://github.com/ello/heroku-buildpack-imagemagick-cedar-14

heroku buildpacks:set --index 2
https://github.com/heroku/heroku-buildpack-nodejs
```

Then deploy your application. This example was based on the nodejs buildpack, but it can be used with
any other. If it is not working with yours, please report a bug.

## Contributing to heroku-buildpack-imagemagick-cedar-14

* Check out the latest master to make sure the feature hasn't been
  implemented or the bug hasn't been fixed yet
* Check out the issue tracker to make sure someone already hasn't
  requested it and/or contributed it
* Fork the project
* Start a feature/bugfix branch
* Commit and push until you are happy with your contribution
* Please try not to mess with the configs.sh. If you
  want to have your own version, or is otherwise necessary, that is
  fine, but please isolate to its own commit so I can cherry-pick around
  it.
